 * Lightweight Fabric.js v7 image editor with masking, animated transforms,

 * ## Quick start (ESM)
 * ```ts
 * import * as fabric from 'fabric';
 * import { ImageEditor} from 'image-editor';
 *
 * const editor = new ImageEditor(fabric, { canvasWidth: 1024, canvasHeight: 768});
 * editor.init({ canvas: 'myCanvas'});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Quick start (CDN / `<script>` tag)
 * ```ts
 * // Assumes window.fabric is populated by a Fabric.js CDN script
 * const editor = new ImageEditor({ canvasWidth: 1024});
 * editor.init;
 * ```

     * Creates a new image editor instance.

     * The constructor accepts two argument shapes so the same source ships
     * to both ESM and UMD consumers:
     *
     * - **ESM form** — `new ImageEditor(fabric, options?)`. The first
     *   argument is the imported Fabric.js v7 module
     *   (`import * as fabric from 'fabric'`).
     * - **UMD / CDN form** — `new ImageEditor(options?)`. The Fabric module
     *   is read from `globalThis.fabric` and the first argument is treated
     *   as `ImageEditorOptions`.
     *
     * Detection is delegated to `fabric/fabric-adapter.ts`. When neither
     * form yields a usable Fabric module, the adapter logs a single
     * descriptive `console.error` and the constructor returns a degraded
     * instance whose `init` and `loadImage` calls become no-ops
     * resolving to `undefined`.
     *
     * Options are normalized through `core/default-options.ts#resolveOptions`,
     * which deep-merges nested `label`/`crop` configs with the documented
     * defaults, drops unknown keys, and freezes the nested references so
     * post-construction mutation cannot affect the live editor
     * The resolved options object is held on the
     * instance as an internal facade field; nothing on the public surface
     * exposes it directly.
     *
     * @param fabricModuleOrOptions Fabric.js module (ESM) or options (UMD).
     * @param options               Editor options when the first argument
     *                              is the Fabric module. Ignored otherwise.

     *   the first mutation. Decode, downsample, Fabric, timeout, or layout
     *   failures replay the bundle and reject with the original error.
     * - On commit, the loader sets `originalImage`, `currentScale = 1`,
     *   `currentRotation = 0`, `baseImageScale`, `maskCounter = 0`,
     *   `_lastSnapshot`, and `isImageLoadedToCanvas = true`. It also
